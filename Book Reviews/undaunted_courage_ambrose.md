Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose. 

Overview: 4.5/5 Engaging and informative - one of the best books I have read in recent months. 

Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose details the early-18th century expedition of Lewis and Clark, with a particular emphasis on Meriwether Lewis, the man. Ambrose does an outstanding job on many levels. 

Ambrose paints an engaging picture of the circumstances behind each event that Lewis and his men faced in their expedition. Each encounter with a new Indian tribe is characterized by new tensions, new stakes, and new ways that Lewis and Clark must choose to deal with the unfamiliarity of the Natives. Each newly traversed landscape - the cascading waterfalls, roaring rivers, and expansive plains - has its individual beauties, not to mention difficulties that must be scaled.

Ambrose also does a very nice job of interweaving his own analysis of Lewis, whether it be his leadership abilities, his talents as an explorer and scientist, or his actions with respect with the natives.  Ambrose is equally likely to praise or criticize when appropriate. And while aided by the filter of hindsight, his opinions add a very fresh and welcome perspective to the story.  

For me personally, there were times when Ambrose's description of events dragged on for a few too many sentences (or pages). The starting description of Lewis's early years in Virginia and under the tutelage of Thomas Jefferson were especially slow. 

I sometimes imagine what it would be like to be in Lewis's shoes, crossing into the sometimes hostile territory of the unknown, facing bitterly cold winters without the guarantee of a constant supply of field. Undaunted Courage allowed me to get an informative account of the journey, while also giving me a comprehensive account of the motives and intentions of the voyage itself. The focus on some of the demons that Lewis faced - alcoholism, manic depression - provided a holistic portrayal of Lewis as a human, and the chilling description of Lewis's suicide remind me that even the greatest and most capable of men have their own struggles.
