Travel Blog: Past Experiences and Motivations

I'm not alone in saying that I love traveling, the opportunity to see all the world has to offer. I was blessed with parents who not only fostered that love but supported it - emotionally, and most importantly, financially - as well. Childhood travel firmly impressed the spectacular cityscapes  of London, Lhasa, and Venice into my mind, and the wanderlust has been just as permanent ever since.

I always look forward to the first moment: stepping out of the airport or the train station and entering a world unfamiliar. Riding to the next destination, I stare out the window in silence, piecing together the vibe around me, noticing any distinct differences between what I see and what I've grown accustomed to seeing. The first moment also quiets my normally busy thoughts; it reminds that while I'm mired in my own world back home, life, unrelenting, goes on across the world, and this is what it looks like. 

Lately, as I have grown older, graduated from college, and started supporting myself, my travels are uniquely my own. I have the freedom to plan my own destinations and to plan my own itinerary. Doing so, gives me a lot more control over what I want to experience. Accordingly, my reflections during these times are very valuable to me, and worth documenting.

Denver: end of 2014 trip: 12/19/2014 - 1/1/2015

2014 was an important year: I graduated college, went to Europe as a member of #fiveguys, moved to the city, and last but not least, started work at LinkedIn. I planned this trip on somewhat of a whim, seeing as I had the time and the resources to go somewhere over the new year work break, I asked why not Denver? 

The rational answer to that question is because it is really fucking cold - it was around 10 degrees today. But I have been spoiled by California weather since 2000, so this is a welcome, albeit not entirely comfortable, change of pace.

Day 1: Snow covered the ground as soon as I stepped out of the airport, and the resulting white blanket dominated my view as I rode from the airport to my hotel in Stapleton. 

My favorite aspect of Denver's landscape from today has to be the untouched, large areas of flat open space that lined both sides of the highway in the surrounding areas of the airport. It is refreshing, especially compared to the clutter of Silicon Valley, where it seems like every inch of land has been not only engineered but optimized for some type of development. 

From my brief interactions with the locals here, I get the impression that mostly everyone is authentically laid back and down to earth, maybe because of the  the natural beauty that surrounds them all the time. Two workers explicitly took the time to personally guide me to where I needed to be when it was clear that I was a little lost. They were nice gestures, again, especially in comparison to Silicon Valley, where everyone is involved in so many different pursuits that time has to be engineered and optimized as well. 

I took the bus from my hotel to downtown and explored **16th Street Mall**and **Latimer Square**. [On a side note - Google maps does an amazing job with its public transportation navigation option. Navigation, and on-the-fly navigation is probably the one area of my life that technology has simplified the most]. The area reminded me of Union Square in San Francisco, except not nearly as bustling (I'm going to assume due to the weather conditions). I walked to Millennium Bridge and caught a glimpse of Coors Field, but honestly, nothing about downtown really stuck out to me. I would have liked to walk around more, but the cold made it much more appealing to be inside.

Tomorrow, I am renting a car and will be exploring some of the parks and wildlife areas around here. 

Day 2: 0 degrees, nowhere to go but up. 

I rented a car, checked out the wildlife refugee and drove about 40 minutes west of where I'm staying to Lookout Mountain in Golden, and the Red Rock Amphitheater in Morrison. The day started off with a small victory when I realized that the AM/FM transmitter that I had left in my backpack for no real reason had a USB outlet that enables car charging. Small, unexpected victories like that are quite enjoyable. 

The fact that I can rent a car from Enterprise and be on the road in less than 10 minutes reminds me that I am fully in control of the trajectory of my own life from now on. In many ways, deciding to embark on this end of the year journey represents that idea as well. The trip will turn out to be very expensive (probably close to $1,000 when all is said and done), and I need to have more restraint with my money by planning further ahead in the future. 

After an initial period of a little trepidation about driving on the icy roads, the familiarity of driving took over. The most challenging parts of driving involved figuring out how to turn on the headlights, figuring out where the line markers where since most of the road was covered in snow, and keeping visibility in my windows by removing the ice buildup. A few times as well, the ice on the road caused the brakes to skid. 

I started by checkout the **Rocky Mountain Arsenal**, located about 10 minutes northwest of where I'm staying. I didn't see much of anything at all - a few birds and some deer/antelope/elk related animals - I'm guessing, hoping that the weather conditions kept them away from view.

Next I headed westward to checkout a few scenic spots to the west of Denver along the I-70: 1) **Lookout Mountain** and 2) **Red Rock Amphitheater**. Driving along the I-70 was quite enjoyable, after passing the city skyline within the first few minutes of the drive, I entered the surrounding mountainous regions of Denver. The hills of these mountains were completely blanketed in white, fresh snow, and the leaves of the trees that covered the hills all adorned a slight touch of white, as if they had each been gently touched by the ends of some master painter; Bob Ross, maybe? The scene reminded me a lot of Tahoe. 

Lookout Mountain would have been much nicer on a clear day. I was hoping to get a glimpse of the city from atop the mountain, but there was too much snow/ice in the air to see very far. I could make out the faint outline of the enormous mountains in the background. The top of the mountain did contain the Buffalo Bill Museum and Grave. The museum gave me some idea of what the west must have been like back in his day. Nonetheless, the overwhelming dominance of white in the landscapes was a bit surreal.

**Red Rock Amphiteater** on the other hand, was incredible. In Morrison, Colorado, about 20 minutes south of Golden, large, imposing formations of red rocks are nestled along the numerous curves of the mountain ranges. Someone had the awesome idea of constructing an outdoor concert venue there, with those majestic rock formations as the backdrop. The Beatles, Tom Petty, Jack Johnson, and many other greats have all played there before. I can only imagine how sublime the atmosphere must be at one of those concerts. Putting it on my bucket list to see a show of one of my favorite artists there. 

On my way back to the hotel, I stopped by Mile High Stadium, and snap chatted Rich, who told me to place a bouquet of flowers there for him. I didn't. There was a nice view of the Denver skyline near Mile High Stadium, which I noticed is a bit larger than I had imagined, but also has no really defining buildings. I happened to pass by the Pepsi Center, and almost impulsively bought tickets to the Laker Nuggets game that night, but decided not to only when StubHub failed to not only verify the zip code on my credit card, but my login credentials as well. In hindsight, thanks StubHub.

Tomorrow, I will set out early in the morning to check out Rocky Mountain National Park, which I am looking forward to.
 
Day 3: 
9:47 a.m. - Lesson learned: Don't let your iPhone run out of battery the night before. I have been ready since 9 am but now I'm waiting for the phone to turn on (which takes a lot longer than I expected), which it just did.

Off to Rocky Mountain National Park! 

Apparently, yesterday was the coldest December 30th ever recorded in Denver, so I can lay claim to braving those temperatures. Today was very sunny, and the clear skies gave me the first glimpse of the mountain ranges that surround the Denver metropolis. It's a great spectacle; the snow capped mountains dwarf the downtown skyline, a poignant reminder of the force of nature. 

My destination was one of those tremendous mountain ranges: and Rocky Mountain National Park was awe-inspiring. I rented snow shoes from Estes Park for $8 for the day, and then made my way to Bear Lake. The trail that I hiked covered 4 lakes: Bear Lake, Nymph Lake, Dream Lake, and ended at Emerald Lake, which is at the base of Hallet Peak (12,173 ft in elevation). The highest point along the trail was over 10,000 feet. Unfortunately, the winter conditions meant that all of the lakes were completely blanketed by snow, meaning that we could walk directly on top of the frozen ice. I would love the opportunity to see the lakes during a time when you can clearly tell that water exists there. 

Words and pictures don't do this park justice; it is truly one of those things that you have to experience first hand. There are numerous points along the trail where you can overlook the rocky mountains and see nothing but a vast expanse filled with trees, lakes, and mountaintops. The peaks themselves are beautiful and formidable, and accompany you alone the entirety of the hike. 

One of my favorite parts of the hiking trail was how it is customary for everyone to greet each other as they pass each other by, and often times, those greetings got extended to longer conversations. One kind lady personally escorted me to the start of the path that I was supposed to follow when it was clear that I was lost. I asked a few people where they were from, and heard back Texas, Phoenix, and Iowa. People were a little surprised when I said I was from California. 

After the Bear Lake hike, I made my way down to Sprague Lake and was surprised by the soothing sound of flowing creek water, which I enjoyed for a while. At the end of the trail when I was driving back to Denver, I noticed a large, yellow plain with mountain ranges in the background. I imagined these plains full of buffalo, bears, and elk, in a time unperturbed by human advancement. In my mind, it was a scene right of the Lewis and Clark voyage. 

I ended the night by attending a reddit board game meet up in Centennial. I know what the typical redditor is like, and will probably be visiting the site less often from now on.

Random anecdotes from today: 
- The station 97.3 is awesome. When they played I Won't Back Down by Tom Petty, a huge smile appeared on my face. 
- They don't sell beer at Colorado grocery stores. 
- My very brief, drive by visit to the University of Colorado, Boulder campus made me nostalgic for college. 

At the time of this entry, it's 11:46 pm on New Years Eve. It's been probably my roughest year to date, and I am actually cherishing the alone time as a time for reflection for myself. 

Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak?, and Colorado Springs tomorrow. To a kick ass 2015. 

TODO: add the maps API of today's route tomorrow at a cafe. 
(This is where I got off the bus...one step later...this is when I realized it was fucking cold)
