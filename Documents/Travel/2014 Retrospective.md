2014: A retrospective 

My 22nd year, to be perfectly honest, was a rough and difficult year for me. There were a few issues that consistently bothered me, which I often brooded about. However, amidst the sometimes turbulent state of mind, I experienced a few amazing moments, amazing places and events shared with my closest friends, that I will remember fondly for the rest of my life. 

**Positives**: Ever since settling into the routine of post college-graduation-work-life, I am increasingly mindful of my day-to-day habits. I am better at establishing positive routines through both consistent application and elimination of destructive behavior. 

Writing: I recently developed the habit of writing every day. Before college, writing was a craft that I took very seriously. During college, less of an emphasis was placed on free form writing as an academic medium, and as a consequence, my writing output dropped to zero.

I started small (regularly advocated by Leo Babuata at zenhabits.net) by writing reviews of books I just finished reading and keeping a journal of recaps of days spent with friends and a few of my inner-most thoughts. I now look forward to my writing time, and am gaining confidence steadily. 

Writing clarifies and virtualizes my thoughts, thoughts that have a tendency to wander astray, and at times, even confuse me. It forces me to think carefully about presentation, organization and cohesion. It focus me to constantly evaluate myself, and the words that I am putting on paper.  Overall, this is the one new habit that I value the most.

Reading: Over the last month of 2014, I set a goal for myself to read a book a week, and have stuck to this goal pretty well. Constantly reading means that I am refining my filtering ability: I am becoming more proficient at getting to the crux of what the author is trying to convey through his or her words. I can also sense my vocabulary expanding, which makes me more eloquent, efficient, and direct verbally. 

Lifting/Exercising: My roommate Rich has a regimen where he works out in the morning 3 times a week, regardless of how he feels or what he did the night before. That diligence and consistency rubbed off on me, and I implemented the same regimen in my life. My goal is to be able to squat 1.5x my body weight (about 255 pounds), and I should, with continued persistence, reach that mark. 

Traveling: In 2014, I made trips to visit the following US cities: Austin, Las Vegas, New York City, Washington D.C, and Denver. I was a part of an amazingly fun trip across Europe with four other college friends, and had the opportunity to visit Dublin, Amsterdam, Brussels, Marseille, Milan, Munich, Zagreb, Budapest, and Prague for the first time. I journeyed down to Coachella Valley for the Coachella Music Festival. Each and every one of these trips contained magical, hilarious, unforgettable moments. 

**Negatives**: 

Comfort Zone: My biggest problem right now is a refusal to remove myself from my own comfort zone, which bothers and frustrates me greatly. This is holding me back tremendously, especially with regards to getting the relationships and the sex that I not only want, but need as well. There have been numerous opportunities to meet women that I do not grasp, and my inaction results in disapproval of myself. A lot of this refusal is rooted in fear, and is something that I simply must face going forward in order to grow as a human being. I must work on this. 

The best way for me to build my ability to expand my comfort zone is again through small, gradual steps. I can start by maintaing my eye contact when they catch with those of others, smile, and offer a greeting. I can start random conversations with people that I do not know at work, and let the momentum build from there. 

Consistency: I need to get better at consistently following through with my endeavors, whether it be side projects, picking up a new hobby, learning a new language, etc. Too many times, I start, but don't apply myself enough to make it into a habit that sticks. I need more consistent application and more resolve in order to grow my abilities. 

Note to self: Don't give up so easily and don't get so easily discouraged! 

**Themes for 2015***

1) Take a conscious effort to create more, as opposed to constantly consuming. 
2) Embrace the unknown, take action. 
3) Expand my comfort zones, Experience growth, Gain confidence. 
4) Contribute value to the world around me: my friends, my family, my company. 
5) Be responsible for my own needs, and seek my own approval first and foremost. 

**Road map for 2015**

For 2015, I am aiming to continue my habits of writing daily and reading a book a week, as well as traveling and working out consistently. 

I want to read and learn more about the following subjects: Nutrition, Human Physiology, World Economy, Dreaming, Statistics 

For my own health, I am aiming to cut down my carbohydrate and sugar consumption. I will eat less snacks at work and cook more inexpensive, healthy, nutritious meals for myself. I need to make getting high quality sleep a priority in my life. 

For more concrete goals: 

1) I want to start teaching computer programming - not with the end goal of becoming a software engineer, but as a means of creative output. Teaching has always been one of my passions, and something that I have not pursued enough in my free time. 

This means that I have to be more diligent with my own side projects in order to build a skill set that I can effectively teach from. Initial ideas include: teaching how to create visual charts using d3, using the Google Maps API to chart routes taken during exploring adventures, and the basic of web applications, how they make end user lives easier by managing information and data. 

I need to be proactive in seeking opportunities to do this, and can start small by teaching Anna individually. 

2) Start a public blog where I write about travel experiences and anything else that I choose to write about 

3) I need to settle in a mutually beneficial relationship with a girl that excites me. 

4) Catch a few waves by learning how to surf

5) Doodle more often, learn to draw 

6) Focus on learning how to both read Chinese food characters and how to cook traditional Chinese dishes 

7)  Exercise: stretch more often, along with more pure cardio workouts
